# Event Scheduling and Conflict Resolution System

A comprehensive event scheduling system implemented in **four different programming paradigms** to demonstrate diverse approaches to solving the same problem. This project showcases imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic programming paradigms.

## 📋 Overview

This system manages event scheduling with automatic conflict detection for:
- **Location conflicts**: Multiple events scheduled in the same location at overlapping times
- **Resource conflicts**: Multiple events requiring the same resource at overlapping times

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Add new events with validation
- ✅ View all events or only conflicting events
- ✅ Edit existing events (title, time, location, resource, description)
- ✅ Delete events with confirmation
- ✅ Automatic conflict detection and re-evaluation
- ✅ Chronological schedule display
- ✅ Filter events by resource
- ✅ Detailed conflict reports with resolution guidance

## 🔧 Implementations

### 1. **Imperative Paradigm (C)**
**File:** `EventSchedulingSystem.c`

**Characteristics:**
- Uses global variables and state
- Imperative control structures (for loops, while loops)
- Direct memory manipulation with arrays
- Step-by-step procedural approach

**Compilation & Execution:**
```bash
gcc EventSchedulingSystem.c -o EventSchedulingSystem
./EventSchedulingSystem
```

---

### 2. **Object-Oriented Paradigm (Java)**
**File:** `EventSchedulingSystem.java`

**Characteristics:**
- Encapsulation of data and methods in classes
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Object composition (ScheduleManager contains Events)
- Method overriding (toString)

**Compilation & Execution:**
```bash
javac EventSchedulingSystem.java
java EventSchedulingSystem
```

---

### 3. **Functional Paradigm (Common Lisp)**
**File:** `event_schedule.lisp`

**Characteristics:**
- Pure functions without side effects
- Immutable data structures
- Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)
- Recursive operations
- Minimal global state

**Execution:**
```bash
# Using SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)
sbcl --load event_schedule.lisp

# Or using CLISP
clisp event_schedule.lisp
```

---

### 4. **Logic Programming Paradigm (GNU Prolog)**
**File:** `event_schedule.pl`

**Characteristics:**
- Declarative rules and facts
- Unification and backtracking
- Pattern matching
- Logic-based conflict detection
- Database-like knowledge base

**Compilation & Execution:**
```bash
# Compile
gplc event_schedule.pl

# Run compiled version
./event_schedule

# Or run in interpreter
gprolog --consult-file event_schedule.pl
```

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Adding an Event

All implementations follow the same workflow:

1. Select **"Add New Event"** from the menu
2. Enter event details:
   - **Title**: Name of the event
   - **Start Time**: Format `HH:MM` (24-hour)
   - **End Time**: Format `HH:MM` (24-hour)
   - **Location**: Room or venue name
   - **Resource**: Professor name, equipment, etc.
   - **Description**: Brief description

### Example Input

```
Event Title: Database Lecture
Start Time: 09:00
End Time: 10:30
Location: Room 101
Resource: Prof. Smith
Description: Introduction to SQL
```

### Editing an Event

1. Select **"Edit Event"** from the menu
2. View the list of all events with their IDs
3. Enter the ID of the event to edit
4. Choose what to edit:
   - Individual fields (title, time, location, resource, description)
   - All fields at once
5. Enter new values
6. System automatically re-evaluates conflicts

### Deleting an Event

1. Select **"Delete Event"** from the menu
2. View the list of all events with their IDs
3. Enter the ID of the event to delete
4. Confirm deletion (yes/no)
5. System automatically re-evaluates conflicts

### Viewing Conflicts

Select **"Detect and Display Conflicts"** to see:
- Conflict type (Location or Resource)
- Conflicting events with details
- Resolution guidance

### Filtering Events

Select **"Filter Events by Resource"** and enter a resource name to view all events using that resource.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Data Structures

Each implementation represents events with:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Title**: Event name
- **Start Time**: Hour and minute
- **End Time**: Hour and minute
- **Location**: Venue
- **Resource**: Required resource
- **Description**: Event details
- **Conflict Status**: Boolean flag

### Conflict Detection Algorithm

```
For each pair of events (i, j):
  If time_overlap(i, j):
    If same_location(i, j):
      Mark as LOCATION CONFLICT
    If shared_resource(i, j):
      Mark as RESOURCE CONFLICT
```

## 🐛 Error Handling

All implementations include:
- ✅ Time validation (hours 0-23, minutes 0-59)
- ✅ Start time must be before end time
- ✅ Input format validation
- ✅ Non-existent event ID handling
- ✅ Graceful error messages

## 📊 Sample Output

```
========================================
CONFLICT DETECTION AND RESOLUTION REPORT
========================================

Conflict 1: Location Overlap
Type: Location Double-Booking
Location: Room 101
Conflicting Events:
  - [ID:1] Database Lecture (09:00 - 10:30)
  - [ID:2] AI Workshop (10:00 - 11:30)
Resolution Guidance:
  - Relocate one event to an available room
  - Adjust event times to avoid overlap
```
